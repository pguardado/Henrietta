/**
 * AboutPage - Explanation of the name "Henrietta"
 * 
 * Design intent: Uses a softened structural field to signal care and 
 * continuity without narrative or decoration. Pattern is architectural,
 * not commemorative. Never reuse this pattern elsewhere.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Ceremonial topographic pattern in margins only
 * - White card-on-field composition for text clarity
 * - Pattern fades near card for breathing room
 * - Tighter corners for architectural restraint

              Henrietta is a person's name. Not a concept. Not a system. Not an abstraction.
            </p>

            <section className="mb-6 md:mb-8">
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We chose it deliberately.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Healthcare is often discussed as policy, infrastructure, or cost. But the consequences of fragmentation are always personal — they land on individual lives, quietly and repeatedly, over time.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Henrietta stands in for that reality.

              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Not as a symbol of suffering, and not as a story we're asking you to adopt — but as a reminder that care ultimately belongs to people, not institutions.

                Why This Name Matters
              </h2>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The name keeps the work grounded. It orients us toward continuity, dignity, and participation — toward care that can be maintained, protected, and carried forward rather than reset each time circumstances change.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                You don't have to agree with the name to take part. You don't have to attach meaning to it to engage.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                But if it resonates, it's because it points back to something simple: care should feel human, stable, and carried forward — not fragmented or temporary.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed font-medium">
                That's the standard the name sets.

                Historical Context
              </h2>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The name Henrietta carries specific historical weight in medical ethics, particularly around consent, ownership of biological materials, and the relationship between patients and medical institutions.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This project draws on that history not to exploit it, but to acknowledge what was taken without consent in the past — and to build infrastructure where consent, ownership, and participation are fundamental from the start.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The name is a commitment to do better.
